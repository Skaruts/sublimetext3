## Monkey 2 language file and snippets for Sublime Text 3

This language file is in development, just as Monkey 2 is. This language file is already behaving fairly well, and therefore I decided to put it out in the public. I will possibly will create an official package for this when things in Monkey 2 land start to settle down.

## installation

Put the **Monkey2** folder into your Sublime Text **Packages/User** folder.
You should now be able to select the Monkey 2 language from the Sublime Text _View / Syntax_ menu.

Example code:
