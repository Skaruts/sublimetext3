## Monkey 2 language file and snippets for Sublime Text 3

This language file is in development, just as Monkey 2 is. This language file is already behaving fairly well, and therefore I decided to put it out in the public. I will possibly will create an official package for this when things in Monkey 2 land start to settle down.

If you find any problems with the language definition or snippets, please let me know by sending me an email or adding an issue to this repository. Thanks!

## Build Systems

Also included are a few simple build systems which enables quick compile of the active tab in Sublime Text. Select the build system from _Tools / Build System_.

Make sure that the **monkey2/bin** folder is included in your system or user path.


## Installation

Create a **Monkey2** folder in your Sublime Text **Packages/User** folder and put the contents of this repository into this new Monkey2 folder.

You should now be able to select the Monkey 2 language from the Sublime Text _View / Syntax_ menu.

Where is the Packages/User folder?
----------------------------------

On Linux this folder is located in __~/.user/sublime-text-3/__
